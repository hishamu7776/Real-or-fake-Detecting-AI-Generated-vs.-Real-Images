# Real or fake: Detecting AI-Generated vs. Authentic Images

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant advances in the generation of synthetic images, generating questions about the veracity of image data. Detecting AI-generated images has become essential for maintaining data integrity. In recent years, remarkable technological advancements have enabled the generation of images of such exceptional quality that it has become difficult for human observers to distinguish them from actual photographs.

This computer vision project seeks to address the growing difficulty of distinguishing between authentic photographs and those generated by artificial intelligence (AI). This project utilizes CIFAKE, a comprehensive dataset of 120,000 images that includes both real and artificial examples.

The primary objective of this project is to investigate various classification problem approaches in an effort to gain insight into the performance of various architectures. This project seeks to analyse the results of each classification method by experimenting with a variety of models, ranging from simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to more complex ones such as ALEXNET, VGG19, InceptionResnetV2, and others. Through this exhaustive investigation, a deeper understanding of each architecture's performance characteristics can be attained.
