# real_or_fake
This project is an image classifier designed to distinguish between real and AI-generated synthetic images. The CIFAKE dataset, which stands for "Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images," is used to train and evaluate the classifier. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately classify images as either real or AI-generated.
