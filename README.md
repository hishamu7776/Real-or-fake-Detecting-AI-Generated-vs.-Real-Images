# Real or fake: Detecting AI-Generated vs. Real Images

This computer vision project seeks to address the growing difficulty of distinguishing between authentic photographs and those generated by artificial intelligence (AI). This project utilizes CIFAKE, a comprehensive dataset of 120,000 images that includes both real and artificial
examples. The primary objective of this project is to investigate various classification problem approaches in an effort to gain insight into the performance of various architectures. This project seeks to analyse the results of each classification method by experimenting with a variety of models, ranging from simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to more complex ones such as VGG16, InceptionV2, ALEXNET, and others. Through this exhaustive investigation, a deeper understanding of each architectureâ€™s performance characteristics can be attained.
